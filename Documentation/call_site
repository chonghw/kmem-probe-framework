Call sites (or The painstaking task of wrestling against gcc)

Compiler inlines *a lot* automatically and without warning.
In this scenario, it's impossible to get *real* call site
based on just calling address.

Does this matter? Perhaps not, as long as you stay on same file
or subsytem to say the least. In this case, we can still get
which subsystem is triggering the allocation event.

If you really need to get the real call site, you have a few
alternatives:

* Explicitly mark the function as "don't inline".
  You can do this through gcc function attribute "noinline".
  This solution is rather impractical, for obvious reasons.

* Use __func__ C99 standard variable instead of builtin_address(0).
  But this would mean changing a lot the tracing code and 
  I think it would be far more expensive.

* Turn off gcc inlining using an options on kernel Makefile.
  The option is called no-inline-small-functions.
  It's still unclear which one is the right one, but it seems to be the latter.
  See this patch:

Of course, this option makes a bit smaller and slower kernel, 
but this is an expected side-effect on a debug-only kernel.

We must keep in mind that no matter what internal mechanisms we use to record call_site
if they're based on __builtin_address, then their accuracy will depend entirely on
gcc *not* inlining automatically.

The enfasis is in the 'automatic' part. There will be lots of functions we will
need to get inlined in order to determine the caller correctly.
These will be marked as __always_inline.
